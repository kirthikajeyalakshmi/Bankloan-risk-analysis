ðŸ“Š Bank Loan Risk Analysis Dashboard

ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement
In the banking sector, loan defaults pose a serious risk. The objective of this project is to analyze customer financial data to help banks make better lending decisions by identifying patterns in customer behavior related to income, deposits, and product usage.

âœ… Solution
I built an interactive dashboard using Power BI to visualize key banking metrics. The dashboard helps in:
Identifying customer segments more likely to repay loans based on income, deposits, and product ownership
Understanding customer behavior trends related to deposits, product usage, and income levels
Exploring how customer profiles (age, occupation, gender) influence financial behavior

The dashboard includes visuals like bar charts, pie charts, and KPIs, making it easy for decision-makers to explore the data without manual analysis.

ðŸ“‚ Dataset Overview
The dataset includes multiple relational tables linked by primary and foreign keys:
Banking Relationship â€“ Account types, loan data, deposit balances.
Client-Banking â€“ Connects clients to their banking activities over time.
Gender â€“ Basic demographic info.
Investment Advisor â€“ Indicates if a client is assigned to an advisor.
Period â€“ Time reference for reporting.

ðŸ’» Tech Stack
Python - Data cleaning and EDA.
MySQL -	Querying and joining relational tables.
Power BI -	Building interactive dashboards.
Excel -	Data formatting for dashboard integration.
Jupyter Notebook -	Documenting exploration and analysis.

ðŸ“ˆ Impact of the Project
Helps identify customers more likely to repay loans using income and deposit behavior
Supports faster decision-making with visual filters and KPIs
Provides insights into product usage patterns and customer segmentation
Lays the foundation for integrating future predictive models or scoring systems

ðŸ”š Conclusion
This project demonstrates how data visualization and analytics can support smarter financial decisions. While it does not include actual loan default data, it offers strong indicators for evaluating loan repayment likelihood and understanding customer behavior.
